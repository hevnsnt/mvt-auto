# backup_ios

**backup_ios** automates the forensic backup and analysis process for iOS devices using the [Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT)](https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt). This tool streamlines the workflow for forensic investigators by automating encrypted backups, decryption, and subsequent IOC-based analysis, all in one go.

## Overview

The Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT) is a suite of utilities designed to simplify and automate the process of gathering forensic traces from mobile devicesâ€”traces that can help identify potential compromises on Android and iOS devices. Developed by the [Amnesty International Security Lab](https://securitylab.amnesty.org) in July 2021 (in the context of the [Pegasus Project](https://forbiddenstories.org/about-the-pegasus-project/)) along with a robust [forensic methodology](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/), MVT continues to evolve with contributions from Amnesty International and the wider digital forensic community.

> **Note:**  
> MVT is a forensic research tool intended for technologists and investigators. It requires a solid understanding of digital forensics and command-line operations. This is **not** intended for end-user self-assessment. If you are concerned about the security of your device, please seek reputable expert assistance.

## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

MVT can leverage public [indicators of compromise (IOCs)](https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt-indicators) to scan mobile devices for traces of known spyware campaigns. These IOCs include datasets published by [Amnesty International](https://github.com/AmnestyTech/investigations/) and other research groups, enabling targeted forensic analysis.

## Features

- **Automated iOS Backup:**  
  Leverages `idevicebackup2` to create encrypted backups of iOS devices.
- **Encryption Management:**  
  Automatically enables and disables encryption on the device as part of the backup workflow.
- **Backup Decryption & Analysis:**  
  Uses `mvt-ios` to decrypt backups and run forensic checks.
- **IOC Integration:**  
  Updates and applies indicators of compromise to scan the decrypted backup for signs of compromise.
- **Realtime Output:**  
  Displays the backup process output in real time to provide transparency and progress feedback.

## Requirements

- **Platform:**  
  Designed for modern Apple Silicon macOS; untested on other platforms.
- **Software Dependencies:**  
  - [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
  - [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx)
  - [libusb](https://libusb.info/)
  - [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- **Additional for Android (Optional):**  
  - Android SDK Platform Tools

### Installing Dependencies via Homebrew

Install the required packages with:

```bash
brew install python3 pipx libusb sqlite3
```

For Android device support (if needed):
```bash
brew install --cask android-platform-tools
```

Next, ensure you have pipx installed and properly set up:
```bash
pipx ensurepath
```

Then install the Mobile Verification Toolkit:
```bash
pipx install mvt
```

This installs the mvt-ios and mvt-android utilities.

### Installation
Clone or download this repository, then build the tool using Go:
```bash
go build backup_ios.go
```
This will create the backup_ios executable.


### Usage
1. Connect and Trust Your Device: Make sure your iOS device is connected and trusted by your computer.
2. Run the Tool: Execute the command:

```bash
./backup_ios
```

3. Follow the Prompts:
* Select the external drive where the backup will be stored.
* If encryption is already enabled, provide the existing backup password when prompted.
* The tool will then:
  * Create a timestamped backup directory.
  * Enable encryption on your device.
  * Perform a realtime backup using idevicebackup2.
  * Disable encryption (unlock the phone) once the backup is complete.
  * Decrypt the backup using mvt-ios.
  * Update the IOC list and run a forensic scan on the decrypted backup.

4. Review Results:
The tool logs its progress and results, and outputs diagnostic messages throughout the process.
